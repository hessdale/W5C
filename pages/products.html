                <h3>Fujifilm Camera</h3>
                <p>The Fujifilm X-T1 was a landmark camera in many ways, with it's extremely high resolution electronic
                    viewfinder, great image quality, weather-sealed body, and engaging control system (we even gave it a
                    Gold
                    award). It's fairly commonplace for camera companies to follow up successful launches of high-end
                    products,
                    such
                    as the X-T1, with a slightly-stripped down, more reasonably-priced alternative that uses many of the
                    same
                    components; a younger sibling, if you will. The Fujifilm X-T10 is exactly that.</p>
